# __Setting up my environment__

```{r setting environment}

#Load the 'tidyverse' package & 'star wars' data set

library(tidyverse)
data("starwars")
```
 
 
 
### __A Quick note on Conflicts:__

Conflicts aren't necessarily a bad thing! Because R is an open source language and anyone can create a package, it's common for different packages to use the same name for similar functions. In our conflicts we see that the _filter()_ function from the _dplyr_ package masks the _filter()_ function from the _stats_ package. We know this because the package name comes before the double colon and the function name comes after, like this:*package::function()*


# __Understanding the Dataset:__

Here's where I like to get a handle on what I'm working with. I'll use various functions to make sure my data imported correctly, and start to get an understanding of the data structure and data types

```{r}
#To check how many rows and columns available in the data frame
dim(starwars)
```
```{r}
#To get the glimps about the data frame like variable names & their datatypes
#Also look at the first few rows of each variable.
glimpse(starwars)
```
### __Quick note on the 'List' data type:__
Lists are the R objects which contain elements of different types like - numbers, strings, vectors etc. In our dataset, there are three variables which have a data type 'list'. The _films_ variable contains the list of star war movies in which the character was appeared, similarly the _vehicles_ variable tells us that, what all vehicles was used by the character.

\newpage
```{r}
#To see the first few rows of data set in  nicely-formatted table.
head(starwars)
```
```{r}
#To view the complete data set
view(starwars)
```

### __a note on the names():__  
I have a really hard time remembering what the names of my variables are, and because R is case-sensitive, how the names are formatted. We could fix this by converting all of our variable names to the same case, but for now just know that if you ever need a refresher on the names of the variables in your dataset (and how they're formatted!) you can run names(), like this:

```{r}
names(starwars)
```
\newpage
```{r}
#To know the unique values from particular variable
unique(starwars$hair_color)
```
```{r}
#To know how many observations are there against the unique values in the variable(categorical)
#also sort it in descending order
#and view in the neat table format like Pivot Table from Excel

View(sort(table(starwars$hair_color), decreasing = TRUE))
```

![Count Of values for variable 'hair_color'](/Users\Admin\OneDrive\Documents\images\Starwars_Unique_Observations_Table.png)
\newpage
```{r}
#To get a frequency bar plot for the the particular variable(categorical)
barplot(sort(table(starwars$hair_color), decreasing = TRUE))

```

\newpage
```{r}
#Using pipes to get the same result

starwars %>% 
  select(hair_color) %>% 
  count(hair_color) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  view()
```

\newpage
## __The NAs!:__   
*NA* stands for "Not Available", meaning data that is missing.If we don't handle our NA values we're going to be in for a bad time


```{r}
#To know the number of missing values in the variable
starwars %>% 
  select(hair_color) %>% 
  is.na() %>% 
  sum()
  
```
```{r}
#To know the number of missing values from all the variables
sapply(starwars,function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
```
```{r}
#exclude NA values while calculations
#na.rm is like asking the question, "Should we remove NAs from our code?"

starwars %>% 
  summarise(avg_height = mean(height,na.rm = TRUE))
```


\newpage
## __Working with the Numeric Variables__

```{r}
#To Know the Minimum, Maximum, Mean etc. values
#For Numeric type variable
summary(starwars %>% 
          select(height))
```
```{r}
#To get the box plot
boxplot(starwars %>% 
           select(height))
```

## __Skills Practice/Learn From This Analysis:__   

1. How to load the packages and data sets in R.  
2. Now I know that 'conflicts' error is not an bad thing.  
3. How to get a sense of the data using functions like 'dim', 'glimps','head'.  
4. Understand the 'list' data types & it is different from the other data types.   
5. How to use the 'names' function to know what the names of variables available in the data set.   
6. How to use 'unique' function to know the unique values available in the categorical variable.   
7. How to use the pipes operator along with the functions like 'select','count','arrange' to drill down the data set.   
8. How to get the number of missing values 'NA' available in the variables from the data set.   
9. How to work with the 'Numeric' data type variable to know their 'Min', 'Max', 'mean' values.   
10. How to plot the box plot & understand how to read it.
